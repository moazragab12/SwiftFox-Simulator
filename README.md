# CPU Scheduler Simulator

**CPU Scheduler Simulator** is a Java-based desktop application built with JavaFX to simulate and visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms in real time. The application offers dynamic process management, live visualization, and detailed statistical analysisâ€”ideal for academic and educational purposes.

## Supported Scheduling Algorithms

1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
   - Preemptive
   - Non-Preemptive
3. Priority Scheduling
   - Preemptive
   - Non-Preemptive
4. Round Robin (RR)

> The application only requests inputs relevant to the selected algorithm (e.g., priority values are not required for FCFS).

## Key Features

- Real-time simulation: 1 second = 1 time unit
- Live Gantt Chart rendering and process timeline visualization
- Dynamically add processes while the scheduler is running
- Real-time table of remaining burst times
- Calculation of:
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
- Option to simulate only predefined processes (static scheduling mode)
- Built as a JavaFX desktop application

## Input Parameters by Scheduler

| Scheduler      | Required Inputs                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| FCFS           | Arrival Time, Burst Time                  |
| SJF            | Arrival Time, Burst Time                  |
| Priority       | Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority        |
| Round Robin    | Arrival Time, Burst Time, Time Quantum    |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- JavaFX SDK (if not bundled with JDK)
- Maven (used for building and running the project)

### Running the Application

### Option 1: Using the Executable EXE

#### Download the ZIP archive containing the Windows executable from [here](https://github.com/MoustafaHashem/SwiftFox-Simulator/releases/download/ReadyToPublish/SwiftFox.zip), then:

#### 1. Extract the ZIP file.

#### 2. Double-click the `SwiftFox-Simulator.exe` file.

#### 3. The application will launch immediately with no additional setup.

### Option 2: Using the Executable JAR

#### 1. Download the compiled .jar file from the dist/ directory.

#### 2. Run the application using:
   ```bush
   java -jar SwiftFox-Simulator.jar
   ```
### Option 3: From Source (Maven)

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoustafaHashem/SwiftFox-Simulator.git
cd SwiftFox-Simulator
```

#### 2. Build and run using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```
Note: Ensure your `pom.xml` is configured to use the JavaFX Maven Plugin and includes the necessary JavaFX modules (`javafx.controls`, `javafx.fxml`, etc.).
